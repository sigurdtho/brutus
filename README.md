# Office project!
### Sigurd, Camilla, Emil, Simon, Chris-the-wiz

## Idea
We have a plant in our office. This plant like every other plant needs water.
To keep track of when we need to water this behemoth, we have installed a
moisture sensor. This sensor is hooked up to a raspberry pi, which shows us
on a display wether it has enough water, or not.

We want to have a webpage for this as well. A place we can go to look at our
plant through a live video feed, and write stuff in a blog like environment.

That is why we have created this repository.

## Goal
Create a smooth django web-page with livefeed and blog and all you could want.

## Specs
- We use sqlite because postgre is too tryhard.
